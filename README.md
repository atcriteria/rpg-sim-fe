# rpg-sim-fe
The Front End for an RPG Simulator based on a previous project of mine. 

## Goals
Below are a few key features I am aiming to implement.
- Create a custom character (done)
- - Allot points into various stats (done)
- - Select a prebuilt character sprite (done)
- Search for monsters appropriate to the player level to battle with
- - Try to have at least 4 unique monsters per range
- - Add random loot for successful battles
- Make more dynamic combat rather than only attacking
- Create an inventory system
- - Weapon and Armor equipables
- - Consumable potions to heal
- Create a shop to unload treasure at and restock potions
